This is a RL project by the name of CartPole. It's a classic control problem that cart can move just right and lift and there is a pole attached to it and the gravity trying to knocks it down.
In this project we use DQN algorithm cause we can't use q-table in here and that is why we use DQN cause it uses neural network.This environment exists in gymnasium library of python programming language.
